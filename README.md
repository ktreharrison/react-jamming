# Create React App - Jamming

This project, I built a React web application called Jammming. It was a larning project using React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
